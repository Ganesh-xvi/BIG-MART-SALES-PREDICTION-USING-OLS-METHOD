                        BIG MART SALES PREDICTION




##  Problem Statement

Develop a machine learning model to predict the sales of individual products at various BigMart stores. This model should utilize historical sales data, product attributes, and store information to provide accurate sales. The goal is to optimize inventory management, stocking, and overall sales strategy for improved profitability and customer satisfaction.
## Goal of this Project

Develop a machine learning model that can predict the sales of individual products in different BigMart stores.

Provide insights and recommendations for inventory management and sales strategy based on the model's predictions.
